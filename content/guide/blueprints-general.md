The way Cloudify users use Cloudify to deploy their application is by utilizing the power of blueprints. Blueprints are written in YAML format and their DSL is based on the [TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tosca/) standard.

To understand how to write blueprints you can read the [Authoring Guide](getting-started-write-blueprint.html).

You can follow the [DSL Specification](dsl-spec-general.html) to learn more about blueprint syntax and elements.

As Blueprints are the basic building blocks for your application, basic information about blueprints can be found within the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) section.
