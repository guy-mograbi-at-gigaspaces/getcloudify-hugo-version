# Overview

As we've [previously seen](getting-started-write-blueprint.html#overview), a Blueprint can contain multiple files. These files can reside under a single directory with subdirectories or an archive. While Cloudify's CLI can take care of archiving process for you during the [upload process](getting-started-upload-blueprint.html), you might want to create archives prior to uploading the blueprint so that you can keep them in a fileserver, upload them via Cloudify's Web UI or send them to others.

In the Getting Started Step by Step tutorial, we will not be creating an archive but rather uploading directly from the blueprint's directory.

# Packaging a Blueprint

There are 2 methods for uploading a blueprint:

* Provide the directory in which the blueprint YAML file resides - which will create a tar.gz from the parent folder and upload it.
* Create a package manually prior to uploading it (steps described below).


When creating a package, the blueprint's archive must include a folder containing the blueprint's resources along with a main blueprint YAML file (defaults to `blueprint.yaml`).

Once the user has the blueprint folder ready with the main blueprint inside it, the user can create a blueprint archive by using the command line:

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true
tar czf blueprint-name.tar.gz blueprint-folder/
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

* The `export` command will prevent unwanted hidden files from being packaged inside the archive (i.e .DS_Store on OSX environment)
* The file and folder names are customizable.

The output file of the tar command above will be `blueprint-name.tar.gz`.

## CLI Archive Formats Support

Currently uploading a blueprint via the CLI supports the following blueprint archive formats:

* tar
* tar.gz
* zip
* tar.bz

## UI Archive Formats Support

Currently, the only supported file extension is tar.gz.


# What's Next

Whether you created a blueprint archive or not, you should now be able to [upload your blueprint](getting-started-upload-blueprint.html) to Cloudify's Management Environment.
