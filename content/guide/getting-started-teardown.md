# Overview

It's also possible to delete the Manager and its accompanying resources (the servers, networks, security groups and any other resource that was configured within the Manager Blueprint) via the CLI.


# Actionable: Teardown the management environment

Next, you can teardown the management environment if you have no use for it anymore.

This can be done by issuing the following command:

{{< gsHighlight  bash  >}}
cfy teardown -f
{{< /gsHighlight >}}

This will terminate the manager VM and delete the resources associated with it.
