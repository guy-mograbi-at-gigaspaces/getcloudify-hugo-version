Cloudify allows users to bootstrap a Cloudify Manager using the Command-Line Interface by utilizing blueprints. These blueprints, while are not functionally different from regular blueprints, are designed to create the infrastructure for Cloudify's Manager and deploy its applicative requirements.

By utilizing blueprints, users can potentially design their own Cloudify Managers for additional scalability or functionality.

Manager blueprints for different IaaS providers are provided by the Cloudify Team. You can find these blueprints either in the [cloudify-manager-blueprints repo](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager-blueprints) or in the IaaS Plugin's repository of your choice.

Refer to the [bootstrapping page](getting-started-bootstrapping.html) to bootstrap a Manager.

This section provides references to the manager blueprints provided by the Cloudify Team and will help you getting started with writing a manager blueprint for the IaaS of your choosing.
