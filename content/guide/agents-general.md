# Overview

Cloudify Agents are entities installed on hosts that are part of your [blueprint]({{page.terminology_link}}#blueprint).

{{% gsNote title="Note" %}}
Some agents are actually also installed outside the scope of a specific host, but usually you wont need to bother
with these agents.
**See the [Terminology page]({{page.terminology_link}}#agent) for a more elaborate explanation on each type of agent.**

Agents are basically a piece of software used for communicating with Cloudify's Manager.

Cloudify's agents provide a way to:

* Execute general [operations]({{page.terminology_link}}#operation). ([Deployment Agents]({{page.terminology_link}}#deployment-agent))
* Execute [operations]({{page.terminology_link}}#operation) on specific hosts. ([Host Agents]({{page.terminology_link}}#host-agent))
* Execute [workflows]({{page.terminology_link}}#workflow) on [deployments]({{page.terminology_link}}#deployment) ([Workflow Agents]({{page.terminology_link}}#workflow-agent))
